# Project httui

## What is httui?
[httui](https://httui.com) is a terminal-based alternative to Postman, designed to be an API testing tool with Vim-like bindings. It is a Text User Interface (TUI) application that simplifies the process of creating, executing, and managing HTTP requests directly in the terminal. httui is open source, allowing anyone to set up the entire infrastructure within their own company.

## Key Features
- **Vim-like Bindings**: Intuitive navigation and commands for users familiar with Vim.
- **Terminal Interface**: The entire httui experience is focused on being used directly in the terminal.
- **Environment Variable Management**: Supports multiple workspaces with environment variables configurable via JSON.
- **Modification History**: Track the history of requests, workspaces, and responses.
- **Offline-first**: Synchronizes data between a local database (SQLite) and the cloud (MongoDB).
- **Parameter and Header Reuse**: Simplifies the configuration of similar requests by reusing parameters or headers in request groups.

## Advantages of httui
- **Open Source**: Open-source code, allowing customization and community contributions.
- **Own Infrastructure**: Set up the entire httui infrastructure within your own company.
- **Subscription Plan**: Use the basic version for free or opt for the premium plan to access exclusive features.
